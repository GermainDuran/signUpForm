# Building a sign up form with ReactJS.  

## Description
- The form has 3 steps:
      1)It collects email and password
      2)Full name and age
      3)It presents a confirmation page.
- The form is in a box centered on the page.
- The steps are distinct (i.e.  they are not in one long form)
- The user is able to go forward and backwards to edit fields before submission.
Between steps 2 and 3, an alert is dispatched to fake an async API call with the user payload.
After the “API call” resolves, the confirmation page thank the user by name for signing up.
- The form is responsive on mobile/desktop view.
